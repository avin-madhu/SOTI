3. Given a number N. Find the minimum number of squares of any number that sums equal to N. For Example: If N = 100, N can be expressed as (10*10) and also as (5*5 + 5*5 + 5*5 + 5*5) but the output will be 1 as the minimum number of square is 1, i.e (10*10).

5. Joseph is learning digital logic subject which will be for his next semester. He usually tries to solve unit assignment problems before the lecture. Today he got one tricky question. The problem statement is “A positive integer has been given as an input. Convert decimal value to binary representation. Toggle all bits of it after the most significant bit including the most significant bit. Print the positive integer value after toggling all bits”.

### Medium Problems

1. A valid IP address consists of exactly four integers separated by single dots. Each integer is between 0 and 255 (inclusive) and cannot have leading zeros.
 For example, "0.1.2.201" and "192.168.1.1" are valid IP addresses, but "0.011.255.245", "192.168.1.312" and "192.168@1.1" are invalid IP addresses.
Given a string s containing only digits, return all possible valid IP addresses that can be formed by inserting dots into s. You are not allowed to reorder or remove any digits in s. You may return the valid IP addresses in any order.

Example 1:

Input: s = "25525511135"
Output: ["255.255.11.135","255.255.111.35"]
Example 2:

Input: s = "0000"
Output: ["0.0.0.0"]
Example 3:

Input: s = "101023"
Output: ["1.0.10.23","1.0.102.3","10.1.0.23","10.10.2.3","101.0.2.3"]
